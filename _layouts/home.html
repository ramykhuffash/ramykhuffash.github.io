    <p>Hey there! I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/ramykhuffash" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/ramy.jpg" width="40" height="40" style="border-radius: 100%;" /> Ramy</a> and this is where I share what I'm working on & learning.</p>
    <p>I'm not currently looking for work, but I'm always happy to chat with customers, founders, or anyone interested in making things.</p>
    <p>The best ways to get in touch are <a href="https://twitter.com/ramykhuffash" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or email at ramy@rocketgems.com</p>
    <p class="text-muted"><small>P.S. The name "Rocket Gems" does't mean anything - I just liked it and the domain was available.</small></p>

    <div style="padding: 2rem 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.3rem;"><strong>Products</strong></h3>
        <p>Here's what I'm working on currently:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><a href="https://pageflows.com" target="_blank">Page Flows</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://dashvine.com" target="_blank">Dashvine</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://uimovement.com" target="_blank">UI Movement</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've worked on a few other things too, but these are where what I spend most of my time on. I'm also actively looking for new pain points that I can potentially help solve.</p>
